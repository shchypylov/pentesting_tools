Using for finding vulnerabilities in web

**knockpy**

Launch with `cd knockpy && knockpy testdomain.com`

Using for finding domains

**nmap**

Launch with `nmap -sV -oN results.txt testdomain.com`

Using for finding open ports on the hosting server

Nice guide: [click me](https://hackertarget.com/nmap-cheatsheet-a-quick-reference-guide/)
    
* -sSV - Makes nmap carry out a SYN Scan meaning that it only sends a syn command to the target if the server responds with a SYN/ACK (synchronization acknowledged) packet from a particular port, it means the port is open. The V flag means carry out a version scan of the open ports that nmap discovers.
* -p- - Instructs nmap to scan all 65535 ports (1-65535), you can also use -p 0-65535 to include port 0, which in very rare cases will return as open however nothing runs on it by default.
* -iL - This flag allows nmap to take an input file containing either domains or IP addresses.
* -oA - Outputs the scan results to the three available formats: .xml, .nmap, .gnmap.
* --min-parallelism 64 - Specifies the minimum amount of parallel processes at one time. This
combined with --min-hostgroup 96 are both performance flags59 for nmap.
* --min-hostgroup 96 - Specifies the minimum amount of hosts to scan in a group.
* -T4 - Specifies a more specific form of timing performance which tunes up more of the flags
for timeouts and more.
* --version-all - Sends additional probes in order to identify a more specific version of the
service running on an open port.
* --reason - Forces nmap to print out the reason as to why a port was determined as open, all going well this should be SYN/ACK as the reason.
* --open - Selects to only show open ports, I use this on and off depending on what I am scanning.
